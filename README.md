# Movies-ETL
Perform ETL on several movie datasets to predict popular films for a streaming service.

# Purpuse ;
   Amazon prime loves the dataset and wants to keep it updated , inorder to do that i created an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables . Then create one function by using Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating dataâ€”and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
